Procedures are the most basic building blocks of your API.

Each procedure is defined by:

1. __Procedure (route) name__ _(required)_
2. __Function call__ _(required)_
3. [Resolver](/docs/api/advanced/resolvers) _(optional)_

The goal of the procedure is to provide route definitions for your API to use later.

## Declaration

```ts
import { api } from '@hulla/api'

const a = api()

a.procedure('hello', () => 'world') // dummy function
a.procedure('sum', (a: number, b: number) => a + b) // with args

// async procedure (+ note we ca also pass function reference)
const getUserById = async (id: string) => db.from('users').where('id', '==', id).select('*')
a.procedure('getUserById', getUserById) 

a.procedure('api-call', (id: string) => fetch(`<your-api>/users/${id}`)) // or a HTTP request
// ^ check out also Request integration for some more fancy stuff with HTTP requests/responses! üì¢
```

You can pass pretty much anything to a procedure.

## Usage

> Procedures are not intended to be used by themselves! üöß

It just provides useful internal handlers for the package, that will come into play later, once you have first defined your [router](router) and created your API, so you can invoke your procedures via a `call`.

```ts
// later after you have created your API (i.e. exampleAPI)

exampleAPI.call('hello') // world
exampleAPi.call('sum', 1, 2) // 3
exampleAPI.call('getUserById', '123') // Promise<{ id: '123', name: 'John Doe' }>
```

Here's how the `getUserById` would look in graphical representation.

<SVGUsage class="mx-auto mt-4" />

## Best practices

Here's some true and tested principles that will do wonders for you in long term if you follow them.

### Server vs client

If you plan on using `@hulla/api` only on client, you can skip this section. Otherwise I'd strongly recommend giving it a read
as it's going to help you scale your application in the long run.

It's good to define your procedures in a way that will work always on server _(this way you can rest assured it will also work on client)_ and allows you to not to repeat yourself - having to define duplicate calls for server / client.

```ts
const getAllUsers = () => db.from('users').select('*')

a.procedure('getUsers', getAllUsers) // ‚úÖ good

a.procedure('client/theme', () => localStorage?.getItem('theme')) // üöß semi ok
// may be a good idea to mark a client only call (i.e. 'client/theme')
// or even better, define a specific client-only router (see Router)

// doesn't have to be useQuery, can be any library or framework specific method
a.procedure('getUsersBAD', () => useQuery({
  queryKey: ['getAllUsers'],
  queryFn: getAllUsers
})) // ‚ùå BAD, DONT DO THIS
```

Two simple rules to keep in mind:

1. Never have two procedures that use the same function twice _(in our example: `getAllUsers`)_.
2. Never bundle client-side packages to your server-compatible APIs _(in our example `@tanstack/query`)_.

<Aside variant="warning" title="Regarding the procedure with useQuery:">
As you could see, we noted the `procedure` declaration with `useQuery` as a bad practice. Why?

1. __Your API no longer works on both server and client!__
2. Your `useQuery` (@tanstack/query) dependency is going to get imported on every single api call, even in modules where you don't use the `Query` version of the calls.
3. You have to manage queryKeys and make sure they are unique across your codebase.
4. Your routes are no longer DRY, multiple definitions of the same routes
5. You don't have a way of passing `queryOptions` unless you specify them as arguments in every call _(how would that even work with `...spread` args? There's no way to access it!)_.

Solution? Use the [`@hulla/api-query`](/docs/api/integrations/query) integration üî•
</Aside>

Generally, your `procedure` should contain only the minimal necessary logic to execute. Any extra logic, that's handled on client (or even server)
that's framework or library specific should not be part of the procedure function declaration. Instead, you should import the client-side logic of that library
only when necessary to avoid importing it on the server or parts of the client where you don't need it.

```ts
// in api router declaration
import { api } from '@hulla/api'

const a = api()
export const usersAPI = a.router({
  name: 'users',
  routes: [
    // ‚úÖ minimal necessary logic, will work on both client and server
    a.procedure('createUser', (user: user) => db.users.create(user)) 
  ]
})
```

```tsx
// then later in your code
import { action } from '@solidjs/router'
import { usersAPI } from '@/api/users'

// ‚úÖ action is a framework specific method, we do not use it directly in procedure
export const createUserAction = action(async (user: User) => usersAPI.call('createUser', user))
```

> Obviously if you decided I'm only going to interact with my data purely with `actions` _(or any other pattern)_
> then you can use it in your `procedures`. 
>
> Generally as your application scales, it's better to keep your
> procedures as minimal as possible, and handle the rest in your framework-specific code.
> or even add a special [adapter](/docs/api/advanced/adapters) for your framework-specific code.

This way you can rest assured your code will be DRY and will work on both client and server without impacting the bundle size.

### Procedure Naming

You can name your procedures however you like - with only one rule to keep in mind.

- You cannot have procedures _(or to be precise - same methods)_  with duplicate names ‚ö†Ô∏è

```ts
// this will throw an Error, warning you about duplicate procedure definitions ‚ùå
// @ts-expect-error
routes: [
  a.procedure('same', (a: string) => a),
  a.procedure('same', (b: number) => b),
]

// exampleAPI.call('same', ...) // now is ... string or number? Maybe a union?
// There's no way to know what the user truly intended :-(

// What if the arg was defined as string | number, then it gets even more confusing!
```

The reason for this is, we don't know which one of the two procedures you'd want to invoke, if you tried to `call` them. We could override them with the last/first defined one, but when you create something twice, more likely than not it's an oversight, so we'll rather throw an error for your safety. ü¶∏ _It's always better to create one extra name than to have non-deterministic function calls!_

One final important distinction to make:

> You can have the same route names with different methods

```ts
// this is ok ‚úÖ, same key but different methods
routes: [
  // note you need the request integration for this, won't work with just const a = api()
  a.request.get('users', 'https://api.com/users'), // method: 'get'
  a.request.post('users', 'https://api.com/users'), // method: 'post'
]
```

To find out more about creating different methods, see the [custom methods](/docs/api/advanced/custom) or the specific [request integration](/docs/api/integrations/requests) we used in this example.
