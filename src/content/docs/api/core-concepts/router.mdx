title: Router
---

Router is the brains of your operations. It creates your API definitions for you and packs some useful utilities along the way!

## Declaration

The declaration of router is straightforward. You pass a configuration object which can contain the following properties:

| Argument       | Type                                                                                          | Status   | Description                                       |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **name**       | `string`                                                                                      | Required | Used for request deduping, key encoding           |
| **routes**  | `readonly [`[`Procedures`](/docs/api/core-concepts/procedures), or other [custom methods](/docs/api/advanced/custom)`]` | Required | Routes definitions, calls you'll be executing     |
| _interceptors_ | [`Interceptors`](/docs/api/advanced/interceptors)                               | Optional | Utility functions ran on every matching event |
| _adapters_ | [`Adapters`](/docs/api/advanced/adapters) | Optional | Integrations and Transformers |


Here's how it looks in practice:


```ts
import { api } from '@hulla/api'

// can pass a function reference, or just define it inside the call definition
const getAllUsers = () => db.from('users').select('*')
const getPokemon = (name: string) => fetch(`https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/${name}`)

const a = api()
export const exampleAPI = a.router({
  name: 'example', // first the router name!
  routes: [ // then the routes - can be the followng
    a.procedure('all', getAllUsers), // procedure
    a.procedure('foo', () => 'foo'),
    a.procedure('poke', getPokemon),
    // ...etc
  ]
})
```

## Usage

You should always export your ready API definition as the result of the `.router()` call

```ts
// path: src/api/users.ts
import { api } from '@hulla/api'

const getAllUsers = () => db.from('users').select('*')
const getUserById = (id: string) => db.from('users').where('id', '==', id).selectFirst('*')

const a = api()
export const usersAPI = a.router({
  name: 'users',
  routes: [
    a.procedure('all', getAllUsers),
    a.procedure('byId', getUserById),
  ]
})
```

and then import it in your code (server/client/wherever)

```ts
// path: any-where-you-want.ts
import { usersAPI } from '@/src/api/users' // (points to your exported API creation)

const allUsers = await usersAPI.call('all') // { id: string, name: string }[] ✅
const john = await usersAPI.call('byId', '0') // { id: '0', name: 'John' } ✅

// @ts-expect-error purposely bad call - super easy to miss (number arg vs string arg)
const badCall = await usersAPI.call('byId', 0) // ❌ type error
//                                     ^ expected 'string', got 'number'
```

## Return type (API)

Apart from `.call` which will be your most frequent use of a created router API, you also have access also to some nice utility methods/properties.

Here is the exact return type after calling your `a.router()`

- `call()` - the main way to interact, the main way to `call` your [procedures](procedures) _(or other route methods)_.
- `routerName` - defined in router definition `name: string`
- `routeNames` - array of passed route names `Routes<RouteName extends string>[number]`
- `context` - the [custom context](/docs/api/advanced/context#custom-context) passed to router.
- `...AdapterMap` - any potential [`adapters`](/docs/api/advanced/adapters) / [`integrations`](/docs/api/integrations) passed.
- `methods` - array of passed route methods _(if only procedures `['call']`)_. Useful if you have multiple inegrations like [`custom methods`](/docs/api/advanced/custom)

## Best practices

Router doesn't really have any gotchas. These are more of general suggestions of tested by time best practices.

### Project structure

- Keep your routers minimal

This way when you import your API accross the application, you don't import unnecessary calls and heavens-forbid unnecessary dependencies. Usually it's good idea to separate routers by their subject matter.

```ts
// even though posts have relation to users (i.e. user has multiple posts). You probably
// don't need all the API calls related to posts when fetching a user's profile.

// path: src/api/users.ts
export const usersAPI = a.router({
  name: 'users',
  routes: [
    /*...*/
  ],
})
```

```ts
// path: src/api/posts.ts
export const postsAPI = a.router({
  name: 'posts',
  routes: [
    /*...*/
  ],
})
```

This also makes it easier to distinguish and navigate individual routes, rather than having 200 calls all in one api export.

### Routes definitions

In the code example above, i've purposely defined `routes` inside the `a.router` definition. Like so:

```ts
a.router({ name: 'users', routes: [a.procedure('all', getAllUsers)] }) // ✅ ok
```

This is due to a fairly common gotcha, caused by typescript treating `const x = []` declarations as arrays instead of tuples by default.

```ts
const routes = [a.procedure('all', getAllUsers)] // => Call<...>[]
a.router({ name: 'users', routes }) // ❌ ERROR: Breaks type inference - array not a tuple
```

Since `@hulla/api` heavily relies on typescript ([which is why it has 97.7% smaller bundle size](/docs/api#caveat-package-size)) compared to similar packages, it's a small price we pay for this luxury -- and you'll have to fix it accordingly:

If you for whatever-reason want to define your routes outside of the router, remember to use the `as const` assertion.<br/>This tells TypeScript it's a tuple and not an array - _(note this has nothing to do with the package, but with how TS treats declarations)_

```ts
const routes = [a.procedure('all', getAllUsers)] as const // => [Call<...>] - note the as const
a.router({ name: 'users', routes }) // ✅ now it works
```
