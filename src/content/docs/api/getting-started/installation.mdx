## Where to next?

If you're not sure where to start, either check the [Quick Start](quickstart) or explore the Core Concepts section as a recommended starting point.

At the very least, you'll need to understand the following concepts:

1. [Procedures](/docs/api/core-concepts/procedures)
2. [Router](/docs/api/core-concepts/router)

If you're already familiar with API/RPC managers, feel free to dive straight into specific examples.

**Even if your favourite framework isn't listed here, 99% chance it's compatible with `@hulla/api`** -- all the package does is organize the calls for you. It does not implement any fetching logic under the hood, that's up to you to provide! If you follow best practices it will work anywhere, be it server, client or a service worker.
