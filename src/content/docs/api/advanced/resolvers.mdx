Here are some common use-cases for Resolvers:

1. Transforming the result of defined [procedure](/docs/api/core-concepts/procedures) function `fn`
2. Accessing [context](context)
3. Triggering side-effects / running middleware _(that only runs on specific routes / depend on return value of procedure function - if you need to run middleware on every single route, you might want to use [interceptor](interceptors) instead.)_
4. Input/Output validation

## Declaration

Resolvers are defined as part of [procedure](/docs/api/core-concepts/procedures) - in particular, the third argument.

```ts
a.procedure('example', () => 'foo', (res, ctx) => ...)
// =>                               ^ this is the resolver
```

Eech resolver is a function that consiss of two arguments:

1. Result of the procedure `fn` _(in example above `res === 'foo'` )_
2. Custom context merged with base context _(in example above `ctx ===` [`Context`](context))_

The return type of resolver overrides the procedure return

```ts
const numFn = (num: number) => num
// and our routes were defined as
[
  a.procedure('fn', numFn),
  a.procedure('resolver', numFn, (res) => res.toString())
]

// later:
exampleAPI.call('fn', 1)  // 1 === number
exampleAPI.call('resolver', 1) // '1' === string (resolver overrode fn return type)
```

## Usage

### Mutating result

Here's a very basic _(and not very practical)_ example, that should help you understand the usage of resolvers better.

```ts
import { api } from '@hulla/api'

const a = api()
export const exampleAPI = a.router({
  name: 'example',
  routes: [
    a.procedure('foo', (a: number) => a, (res) => res.toString())
  ]
})

// then later:
exampleAPI.call('foo', 1) // '1'
```

Hopefully you should get the gist of it, obviously this pattern is a lot more powerful, when you have some complex calls and chained interactions.

### Accessing context (& mutating result)

As an example, we have a site where user can select theme, while even being logged out of the site. We want to update the user
with their selected theme after they logged in and log the last action executed on their profile.

```ts
import { api } from '@hulla/api'
import { $theme } from '~/stores'
import { getCurrentUser, updateUser } from './queries/users'

const context = { theme: $theme.get() }

const a = api({ context })
export const usersAPI = a.router({
  name: 'users',
  routes: [
    a.procedure('update-theme', getCurrentUser, async (res, ctx) => {
      const user = await res // we await the Promise from the getCurrentUser
      const payload = { ...user, theme: ctx.theme, lastAction: ctx.route }
      return updateUser(payload) // update user with current theme
    })
  ]
})

// then later:
const afterLogin = async () => {
  await usersAPI.updateTheme()
  // ....
}
```

### Input/Output Validator

Consider the following sample calls

```ts
exampleAPI.call('copyUser', 'John', 'john@email.com') // âœ… ok
exampleAPI.call('copyUser', 'John', 'incorrectEMAIL123') // ðŸš§ ok by TS
// (email is string, even though in incorrect format) -> we need a validator!
```

```ts
import { api } from '@hulla/api'
import { createUser } from './queries/users'
import { z } from 'zod'
// note we don't have to use zod, can write our own validator for all intents and purposes

const schema = z.object({
  name: z.string()
  email: z.string().email()
})

const toUserObject = (name: string, email: string) => ({ name, email })

const a = api()
export const validatedAPI = a.router({
  name: 'validated',
  routes: [
    a.procedure('copyUser', toUserObject, async (user) => {
      const payload = schema.parse(user) // throws error if incorrect
      const newUser = await createUser(payload) // âœ… ok 
      // could just return createUser(payload), but for demonstration purposes:

      // not very practical / redundant in this particular example
      // but just to showcase you can also validate output as well -- 
      // in practice you'd more likely validate if you had multiple calls
      // (i.e. get user posts and validate them and return them alongside the validated user)
      return schema.parse(newUser)
    })
  ]
})
```

This is useful for adding extra safety that typescript cannot catch

### Reusable resolvers

It might be useful to re-use some resolvers. But first, ask yourself the question -- _Do I need the resolver to run for every single route?_

> If you need a resolver to execute on every single route, then it might be more practical to use an [interceptor](interceptors) instead.

If you chose not to use an interceptor and write re-usable resolver instead _(which has it's benefits with extra type-safety, but as a trade-off is pretty rigorous about types and it's definition)_, then here's
good blueprint.

__Simple version__ - result only

```ts
import { api } from '@hulla/api'

// I've got the following two functions defined:
const fromString = (str: string) => str
const fromNumber = (num: number) => str.toString()

// as long as ReturnType matches the type of function (in this case both 'string', we're good)
// if they were different, you'd need to account for it (i.e. res: string | number | boolean)
const resolver = (res: string) => res + 'bit'

const a = api()
export const exampleAPI = a.router({
  name: 'example',
  routes: [
    a.procedure('fromString', fromString, resolver)
    a.procedure('fromNumber', fromNumber, resolver)
  ]
})
```

That was fairly straightforward.

Issue begins when you need proper type safety of your [`context`](context).

First, here's a semi-hackish version where we don't have correct type of context, but for our intents and purposes it's good enough type narrow

```ts
// This works as well (picking parts of context we only need)
const resolver = (res: string, ctx: { foo: 'foo' }) => res + ctx.foo  // âœ… this works as well!
```

That was easy as well!

> However what if we wanted full type safety of the exact Base Context we have in our resolvers, when we are typing resolvers inside our `a.procedure`?

Generally it's always preferrable to write your  resolvers inside of procedure definitions _(when possible/reasonable)_. Issue is, this is not exactly re-usable (other than copy-pasting)

```ts
const a = api({ context: { foo: 'foo' }})
a.procedure('example', () => null, (res, ctx) => ctx.foo) // 'foo'
// => full type-safety out of the box, both custom and base context 
```

As you'll see it starts being a lot less
straightforward real quick, as essentially you'll need to type out all the stuff manually, that the package infers under the hood for you ðŸ¦¸.

```ts
// we'll import the api sdk and the Context type (Base Context)
import { api, type Context } from '@hulla/api'

// I've got the following two functions defined:
const fromString = (str: string) => str
const fromNumber = (num: number) => str.toString()

// And the context
type CTX = { foo: 'foo' }
const context: CTX = { foo: 'foo' }

// Now we want to define a re-usable resolver, we'll need the following types

// in practice you'd probably use generics or define it inside the function straight away
// but i'm writing everything out this way so it's clear and punctual

// 1. Return type of the functions (in our case `string`)
type Res = string
// 2. Combination of possible args (in our case `readonly [string] | readonly [number]`)
type Args = readonly [str: string] | readonly [num: number]
// 3. Route name (in our case 'fromString' | 'fromNumber')
type Routes = 'fromString' | 'fromNumber'
// 4. The method (in case of procedures - 'call')
type Method = 'call'
// 5. Router name
type RN = 'example'
// 6. Type of Custom Context (defined above)

// our re-usable resolver definition
const resolver = (res: Res, ctx: CTX & Context<Routes, Method, Args, RN>) => {
  // note the intersection `&` merging custom context `CTX` with base context `Context`
  return ctx.foo + res + 'bit'
}

// Time to put it all together:
const a = api({ context })
export const exampleAPI = a.router({
  name: 'example',
  routes: [
    a.procedure('fromString', fromString, resolver)
    a.procedure('fromNumber', fromNumber, resolver)
  ]
})
```

Well that was bit of a hassle, but it ensures our resolver are re-usable and fully type-safe!
If you don't care about type-safety as much, you can kind of hackishly work-around with [interceptors](interceptors). Even though generally I would recommend taking the extra time and typing out interceptors instead as it ensures
your types are always correct and does not necessitate type assertions.

Honestly it's not that difficult to write once you write a couple of re-usable resolvers of your own. Just takes some time getting used to all the types you need to pass ðŸ’ª
