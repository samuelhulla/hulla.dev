<Aside variant="note">
Adapters are primarily intended to be used by library authors, that build integrations on top of `@hulla/api`. It is very likely
you will not need to understand the concept of adapters for your project.
</Aside>

Adapters are a way of extending your exported API functionality with custom functions that execute on top of your defined router.

There are many options as to what you can do with an adapter, some of the use-cases include:

- Modifying calls to mutate result or arguments
- Extending functionality of existing calls _(like [query integration](/docs/api/integrations/query) or [swr integration](/docs/api/integrations/swr))_
- Adding middleware
- Adding constants

## Declaration & Usage

Adapters are defined as an optional argument of the [router](/docs/api/core-concepts/router) call.

```ts
import { api } from '@hulla/api'

const a = api()
export const withAdapters = a.router({
  name: 'example',
  routes: [],
  adapters: {
    logRouterName: (adapter) => () => console.log(adapter.routerName)
  }
})

withAdapters.logRouterName() // 'example'
```

## Router Adapter API

One thing that warrants a special mention is the fact, that router contains __not only all of the methods of your [router API](/docs/api/core-concepts/router)__, but also the following internal methods, that can help you write more effective adapters:

- `find` - utility function that returns a `{ route: string, call: Function }` object.
- `invoke` - utility function, call `find` and invokes the function with args and any possible [interceptors](interceptors)
- `mappedRouter` - nested object that encodes individual methods with functions - i.e. `{ call: { foo: Function }}`

Check out the [Adapter API Reference](/docs/api/reference/adapters) for more info

## Adapter declaration syntax

If you studied the initial example with a keen eye, you may have noticed, that the adapter `logRouterName` is a curried callback - a function that returns a function. This is intentional, to prevent a common mistake a lot of people make when writing their adapters. Consider this:

```ts
adapters: { isAuthenticated: (_adp) => db.auth() } // ðŸ˜± DON'T DO THIS
// note we don't need adapter arg here, just making it explicit it's available if necessary
```

Looks relatively ok on first glance, and you'd expect it to work as `usersAPI.isAuthenticated // boolean`  but this is actually a mistake! Adapters are executed at the `create` call with the passed router and this means, every time you tried using `usersAPI` it would execute the `db.auth()`, which could potentially be an issue, especially if you are using it inside client JSX that continually hydrates. For this reason, the line above actually  __a type error__!

The proper way to do this would be:

```ts
const usersAPI = a.router({
  name: 'users',
  routes: [],
  adapters: { isAuthenticated: (_adp) => () => db.auth() } // âœ… correct
  //         note the extra callback here ^
})
```

Now instead of ~~`usersAPI.isAuthenticated`~~ we call `usersAPI.isAuthenticated()` - this executed the `db.auth()` only when we need it to, instead of every time the `usersAPI` is accessed.

## Declaring constants (override)

As mentioned, you will get a type error if you attempt to create a constant instead of curried function.

This is to prevent you some pesky hydration errors and racking up your cloud service provider bills. That being said, if you despite the warnings want to override this, the package does give you the power to do it.

```ts
// @ts-expect-error i know what i'm doing and am aware it will run on every call
const your = a.router({
  name: 'smug-self-praise',
  routes: [],
  adapters: {
    // @ts-expect-error i know what i'm doing and am aware it will run on every call
    FAVORITE_PACKAGE: (_adp) => '@hulla/api'
  }
})

your.FAVORITE_PACKAGE // '@hulla/api'
```

## Difference between adapters and custom methods

While both are primarily used by library authors for integrations, there are some key differences

| Difference | [Adapters](#declaration--usage) | [Custom Methods](custom) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| __Intended use__ | Adapting already defined routes | A way of defining new routes |
| __Defined in__ | Inside the `.router()` call | Inside the `api()` initalization |
| __Used in__ | in your API calls (exported `.router()` result) | `routes` parameter of `.router()` |
| __Argument__ | `RouterAdapter` | `Context` |
| __Return Type__ | Object with adapter methods | Object with custom methods |
