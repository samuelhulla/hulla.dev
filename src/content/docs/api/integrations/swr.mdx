title: swr integration

import Aside from '../../../../components/Aside.astro'

This is an official integration for [`@tanstack/query`](https://swr.vercel.app/). 
Here's some quick info about it

- It takes care of `queryKey` encoding and decoding for you
- It has 100% coverage/compatibility with all swr features

Plus it enforces best practices and helps with plethora of complications you'd _likely_ not even think about _(read the motivation section_ ü§ì _)_

## Motivation

Why should you use this integration? Imagine you got an api interface with multiple requests

```ts
const router = a.router({
  name: 'example',
  routes: [
    a.procedure('getAllUsers', async () => db.from('users').select('*')),
    a.procedure('getUserById', getUserById)
    // and 15 other procedures like this...
  ]
})
```

This works nicely on server and some basic client calls, but you decide to integrate `swr` to provide some caching on client
and smoother optimistic updates.

Easiest way is to do this, is to append a route version of our api calls with `useSWR`:

```ts
// ‚ùå DON'T DO THIS!!!
routes: [
  a.procedure('getUserById', getUserById),
  a.procedure(
    'getUserByIdSWR',
    (id: string) => useSWR(['getUserById', id], () => getUserById(id))
  )
]
```

<Aside variant="warning" title="However, this pattern is bad for multiple reasons:">
1. __Your API no longer works on both server and client!__
2. Your `useSWR` (`swr`) dependency is going to get imported on every single api call, even in modules where you don't use the `SWR` version of the calls.
3. You have to manage queryKeys and make sure they are unique accross your codebase.
4. Your routes are no longer DRY, multiple definitions of the same routes
5. You don't have a way of passing `SWROptions` unless you specify them as argument in every call _(how would that even work with `...spread` args? There's no way to access it!)_.
</Aside>

Luckily, this integration remedies all 5 of these issues! üéâ


## Installation

```bash
# Depending on yur package manager:
pnpm add @hulla/api-swr
bun add @hulla/api-swr
npm install @hulla/api-swr
yarn add @hulla/api-swr
```

> All the chapters presume you've done the setup as described in the [Setup](#setup) section below.

```ts
import { api } from '@hulla/api'
import { swr, mutation, queryKey } from '@hulla/api-query'
// note the package is tree-shakeable, so you can import only what you need
// to see which methods you need for which calls, check the table of contents to the right ->
// i.e. if you only need to do useSWR calls, just import { swr } from '@hulla/api'

const a = api()
const usersAPI = a.router({
  name: 'users',
  routes: [
    a.procedure('getUserById', getUserById),
    a.procedure('getUsersPage', getUsersPage),
    // ...
  ],
  adapters: { swr, mutation, queryKey }, // add the integration adapters here üöÄ
})
```

Now we'll go over individual integration methods and how they can be converted to `swr` calls.

## swr

All the `swr` method (`import { swr } from '@hulla/api-swr'`) does, is create a `SWROptions` array for you
to re-use in your query related calls.

Consider the standard call we'd use in the base version of `@hulla/api`

```ts
usersAPI.call('getUserById', '123') // how you'd standardly call it
// => Promise<User>
```

To transform this into a query options config, we'll just add a `.swr` before the `.call` method.

```ts
usersAPI.swr.call('getUserById', '123')
// => [
//      readonly [`${method}/${router}/getUserById', arg: '123'],
//      () => getUserById('123') }
//    ]
```

### useSWR

We'll start off with the most basic example - a standard [`useSWR`](https://swr.vercel.app/docs/data-fetching) call.

Accessing a swr query is as simple as accessing a standard call.

```ts 
function App () {
  const [queryKey, queryFn] = usersAPI.swr.call('getUserById', '123')
  const { data, error } = useSWR(queryKey, queryFn)
}
```

<Aside title="Pro tip!" variant="note">
If you don't want to destructure/spread the array every time, export your own version of `useSWR` as so:

```ts
// src/lib/hooks/swr.ts
import useSWRInternal from 'swr'

export function useSWR<QK, QF>(data: [QK, QF], options?: SWROptions<QK, QF>) {
  const [queryKey, queryFn] = data
  return useSWRInternal(queryKey, queryFn)
}

// then later:
import { useSWR } from '@/lib/hooks/swr'
const { data, error } = useSWR(usersAPI.swr.call('getUserById', '123'))

// Also note, you can do the same pattern for useSWRInfinite, useSWRSubscription, etc.
```

If you're asking, why the package doesn't export this helper for me? It's because
it doesn't have a peer dependency to swr not to muddy the dependency tree. Hear me out why it's actually a good thing: üëá

 While copy-pasting this code is a tiny hassle, it doesn't obstruct
the dependency tree of your project. If you did `import { useSWR } from '@hulla/api-swr'` you'd have no way of knowing
that the `useSWR` method is identical to `useSWR` of `swr`. This way you can be 100% sure, that if you have an error
with the `useSWR` method, then it 100% is from that `swr` package itself and not something weird happening in the `@hulla/api-swr` exported wrapper.
So yes, you'll spend 5 extra seconds copy-pasting this code-sample, but now you have clear distinction as to which package does what and it's a win for your project architecture in the long run! üöÄ
</Aside>

### useSWRInfinite

While you can cover most use-cases with just `useSWR` _(including pagination)_, sometimes you do need [infinite queries](https://swr.vercel.app/docs/pagination#useswrinfinite).

It works the same as `useSWR`, since the `.swr` just returns a key and function.

```ts
const [queryKey, queryFn] = usersAPI.swr.call('getUsersPage', { page: 1 })
const { data, size } = useSWRInfinite(queryKey, queryFn)
```

### useSWRSubscription

For subscribing to real-time data sources, `swr` exports a handy [`useSWRSubscription` hook](https://swr.vercel.app/docs/subscription).

It operates the same way, the only distinction being, that the route fn you pass to your procedure must match the `swr subscribe` type.

```ts
// this is how swr defines it
subscribe: (key: Key, options: {
  next: (error?: Error | null, data?: Data) => void
}) => () => void): { data?: Data, error?: Error }
```

As long as the given fn matches this type, you can use the same syntax as above

### preload (Prefetching)
Same as a `swr` call

```ts
const [queryKey, queryFn] = usersAPI.swr.call('getUserById', '123')
preload(queryKey, queryFn)
```

## mutation

Unlike in the [@tanstack/query integration](query), the `mutate` method of `swr` has the same arguments as `swr`.

Technically you could just use the `.swr` call and it will have the same effect as calling `.mutation` _(as we re-export the same function under the hood anyways)_

But if you want to be explicit in your code _(like me)_, you can use the `mutation` method instead.

### useSWRMutation

```ts
import useSWRMutation from 'swr/mutation'

const [mutationKey, mutationFn] = usersAPI.mutation.call('addUser', { id: '123', name: 'John' })
const { trigger } = useSWRMutation(mutationKey, mutationFn)
```

Note, the `mutate` function is going to be described in the next chapter, because it behaves slightly differently.

## queryKey

And last but not least, we have the `queryKey` method. This is a utility function that helps you decode your queryKeys.

One thing you need to understand, the package encodes queryKey for you. While it may be a small learning curve, from typing out
your queryKeys manually, it's a huge benefit in the long run.

Especially if you have a large codebase, and when you do in `usersAPI.call('create', ...)` you don't want it to invalidate queries with other
create initial keys (i.e. `postsAPI.call('create', ...)`). Or even worse, if you have a `GET` and `POST` method with same url. 

That's why the package encodes the `queryKey` for you, to save you a lot of hassle.

### mutate (Revalidation)

swr apart from `useSWRMutation` also exports _(least to me, somewhat confusingly named)_ `mutate` function, which invalidates
query cache for a given key. Unlike `useSWRMutation` which expects entire length of data, `mutate` only expects the key, and optionally, some other data.

```ts
const { mutate } = useSWRConfig()
const [mutationKey, ...data] = usersAPI.queryKey('getUserById', '123')
mutate(mutationKey, data)
```

If youre using a bound mutation, you don't have to pass anything, hence you don't need to use `queryKey` at all.

### Caveat: queryKey vs swr.call()[0]

If you're asking yourself:

> Since [`swr`](#swr) integration method already returns query key as first array item, why can't i just use that instead?

Well, first off, congratulate yourself as very observant and pat yourself on the back for a very good question.

Second of all, there's a good reason for it -- When doing stuff like [Revalidation](#mutate-revalidation)  you may not need to 
always pass the entire length of query key. Cosnider this example

```ts
export const tAPI = a.router({
  name: 'tricky',
  routes: [
    a.procedure('getById', async (id: string) => getUserById(id)),
  ],
  adapters: { swr, queryKey },
})
```

Now depending on our usecase

```ts
// in a useQuery
useSWR({
  ...tAPI.swr.call('getById', '123') // ‚úÖ Here the `id` must be passed!
//...tAPI.swr.call('getById') // ‚ùå (TypeError) This doesn't make sense, what `id` do I fetch?
})

// however, in mutate (revalidation)
const [mutationKey, ...data] = tAPI.queryKey('getById', '123') // ‚úÖ Here the `id` was be passed!
mutate(mutationKey, data)

const [mutationKey] = tAPI.queryKey('getById') // ‚úÖ Here the `id` wasn't passed, also valid!
mutate(mutationKey) 
```

That's an important distinction to make in terms of type-safety. Essentially `swr.call` necessitates, that you pass all the defined arguments in the query function,
meanwhile `queryKey` just requires the name of the route _(in this case procedure.)_ 

| method | type signature | example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| swr | All parameters must be defined | `readonly ['getById', string]` |
| queryKey | First parameter must be defined, rest doesn't have to be be defined | `readonly ['getById', string` `\|` `undefined]` | 

## All other methods

If you can't find a specific method that `swr` implements, it's likely that you can just make it work
with combination of `swr`, `mutation` and `queryKey` methods, as long as you understand what they do.

> Least to my knowledge, right now `@hulla/api-swr` is 100% compatible with all `swr` features.

However if you're still struggling to make something work, or a new version of swr was added which no longer works with the integration, 
please check the links to the right, and either submit an issue or even update, contribute to the package / docs if you found the solution out and help me and others out. ‚ù§Ô∏è
