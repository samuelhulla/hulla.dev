Requests (and `fetch` in particular) is a complicated matter with a lot of pitfalls. Luckily there's now a way
to eliminate a lot of the frustrations in a very simple way.

## About integration

`@hulla/api-request` is an an offical `@hulla/api` integration that:

- Helps you write `@hulla/api` compatible route _(set of custom methods)_
- Type-checks Request and Response, built on top of `fetch` API,
- Extends requests with type-safe `data` and `params` properties
- Provides utilities for resolving responses and data

It helps you structure and validate your requests and performs type-safe data parsing.

## Motivation

You can do a fetch request with just a `procedure` just fine.

```ts
a.procedure('getUsers', () => fetch('api.com/users')) // Promise<Response>
```

For small one-off calls to external APIs it's likely enough to have them like this.
However, as soon as you have a dedicated back-end API your front-end communicates with, this approach can get unwieldly real quick.

Want a demonstration? Consider just these two endpoints alone. How could this ever get complicated?

- `GET api.com/posts` - Fetches all posts
- `POST api.com/posts` - Creates a new post

And I want to structure my API in a way I call the api route segments

```ts
// ‚ùå DON'T DO THIS
routes: [
  a.procedure('/posts', () => fetch('api.com/posts')), // get all posts
  a.procedure('/posts', (data: Post) => fetch('api.com/posts', {
    body: data
  })) // create a post
]
```

<Spoiler title="There's multiple things wrong with this. Did you spot them?">
1. First off, `@hulla/api` core package, will throw an error, because you defined route with same method and keys

  ```ts
  example.call('/posts', ...) // ü§î Which arguments should I require? 
  // None for 'get' or Post data for 'post'
  ```
2. I intentionally left out the `method` property in the `POST` method version of the `fetch` call, so it defaults to `GET`. Bit insideous from me? Sure. 
   But you can see how easy this is to miss and you just made the wrong call that will not even get an error, since `body` gets ignored in `GET` calls, so the bad call silently passes! üò±
3. In the second call, the `body` property was not serialized properly. Your `fetch` will not work as it does not accept a js object.

</Spoiler>

Well that was a doozy! üòÆ‚Äçüí® Wouldn't it be nice if a package could catch all these mistakes before they make it to production?


## Installation

Installation is very simple:


```bash
# Depending on yur package manager:
pnpm add @hulla/api-request
bun add @hulla/api-request
npm install @hulla/api-request
yarn add @hulla/api-request
```

## Usage 

> All the chapters presume you've done the setup as described in the [Setup](#setup) section below.

### Setup

First,  we'll need to add the [custom method](/docs/api/advanced/custom) inside your api file:

```ts
import { api } from '@hulla/api'
import { request } from '@hulla/api-request'

const a = api({
  methods: ctx => ({
    request: request(ctx)
  })
})
```

### Defining your requests

Now we're ready to define our requests. We'll use the `request` method we've defined in the previous step.

A request must be defined in a `request.method` format, where it takes the following arguments:

1. Route name (same as [procedure](/docs/api/core-concepts/procedures))
2. Fetch body
<ul class="list-none relative bottom-2">
  <li>2.1 Defined as `string`</li>
  <li>2.2 Defined as `URL`</li>
  <li>2.3 Defined as `Request`</li>
  <li>2.4 Defined as `TypedRequestConfig` _(‚úÖ Recommended, `RequestInit` with extra type safety)_</li>
  <li>2.5-2.9 Any of the above mentioned options (2.1 - 2.4) in a function variant</li>
</ul>
3. Resolver _(optional)_ - default [`response`](#response-type-safety) resolver

Check the examples below to see it in practice.


### Static requests

```ts
export const usersAPI = a.router({
  name: 'users',
  routes: [
    // these 4 calls are equivalent in result // Enumerated Fetch body variants (list above)
    // the recommended way ‚úÖ (all you'll really need): 
    a.request.get('allUsers', { url: 'api.com/users' }) // 2.4
    // for completion sake, the other variants (you prob don't need them üöß)
    a.request.get('allUsers', 'api.com/users'), // 2.1
    a.request.get('allUsers', new URL('api.com/users')) // 2.2
    a.request.get('allUsers', new Request('api.com/users')) // 2.3
  ]
})
```

> For the remainded of the documentation we'll be using only the `TypedRequestConfig` (2.4) variant.  It provides the most type-safety and is the recommended way of defining requests. _You'll see why in the following chapters ü§ì._

### Passing arguments (dynamic requests)

While the example above works nice and dandy, we often need to pass parameters to our requests. 
That's when the function variants (2.5-2.9) come in handy

```ts
export const usersAPI = a.router({
  name: 'users',
  routes: [
    a.request.get('userById', (id: string) => ({ url: `api.com/users/${id}` })),
    a.request.post('createUser', (data: User) => ({
      url: 'api.com/users',
      body: JSON.stringify(data)
    })),
    // noticed the `post` method in the second request? üí°
  ]
})
```

### Calling the requests

Considering we used the exported `usersAPI` from example above

```ts
usersAPI.get('userById', 'abc123')
usersAPI.post('createUser', { name: 'John Doe', age: 30 })
// Note: we access the routes by their individual HTTP methods! 
```

Both of these return a `Promie<Response>` that you can work with.
If you wish to type / resolves your request data, check the [Response Resolver](#response-type-safety) section below.

## Good to know

While the examples above are enough for most use-cases and to get most projects started, there are some more topics that might be of interest to you.

### Data vs body (serialization)

The standard `body` property can be kind of annoying to work with. It is pretty rigid in terms of what types it accepts.
If you don't care much about the `body` property, you can use the `data` property instead. It's a bit more flexible and can be used in any request method.

```ts
export const usersAPI = a.router({
  name: 'users',
  routes: [
    a.request.post('createUser', (data: User) => ({
      url: 'api.com/users',
      data, // instead of body
    }))
  ]
})
```

- If you pass a `data` property, the package will call `JSON.stringify(data)` under the hood to construct the body for you
- If you wish to use different serialization tactic, just pass the `body` property instead

```ts
// Example of using custom serialization
import { stringify } from 'superjson'

export const usersAPI = a.router({
  name: 'users',
  routes: [
    a.request.post('createUser', (data: User) => ({
      url: 'api.com/users',
      body: stringify(data)
    }))
  ]
})
```


### Request Type safety

First off, let's start with the most obvious thing:

```ts
a.request.put('updateUser', (data: User) => ({
  url: 'api.com/users',
  data,
  method: 'POST'
})) // ‚ùå TypeError: type "POST" is not assignable to "PUT" | "put"
```

That one's fairly self-explanatory. How about this?

```ts
a.request.get('getUser', (id: string) => ({
  url: 'invalid-url!users',
})) // ‚ùå Error (runtime): Invalid URL
```

Now time for a little brain teaser.

```ts
// see if you can spot what's wrong here: üëÄ
export const usersAPI = a.router({
  name: 'users',
  routes: [
    a.request.get('getUser', (user: User) => ({
      url: 'api.com/users',
      body: JSON.stringify(user)
    }))
  ]
})
```

Noticed the subtle error? If not, don't worry, it's a very common mistake that got through many-a-code-review.

<Spoiler>
The passed request is a  `GET` request, which means it cannot have a `body` _(or well, technically it can, but it doesn't get passed)_. The correct way to define the request would be:

```ts
a.request.get('getUser', (user: User) => ({
  url: 'api.com/users',
  body: JSON.stringify(user)
})) // ‚ùå TypeError:
//  Type 'string' is not assignable to TypeError<
//    "ERROR: method "GET" cannot contain a body", 
//    "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request/body"
//  >

// Since this is a TypeError and not a runtime-error, if you really wish to pass a `body` 
// (e.g. your frame-work has special fetch polyfill that allows body in GET)
// just do a //@ts-ignore and it will work
```
Luckily the package will catch this mistake for you and throw a typescript error. 
</Spoiler>

The package helps you make your requests more type-safe and catch common mistakes early on.


### Response Type Safety

Each `request.method` call has a third argument, a [resolver](/docs/api/advanced/resolvers) function, just like in [procedures](/docs/api/core-concepts/procedures). 

By default it calls an intenral resolver called `response` which returns a `Promise<Response>`. Which is what standard a `fetch` returns, but if you're like me, you probably want more type information than that.

> Under the hood, the default resolver is a complex function, which does type-checking, parses `URL`, adds a `method` to the `Request`, and returns the `Response`, so it's 
> a good practice to always use it. If you're curious, you can read more about it in the [custom resolvers](#custom-resolvers) section

```ts
import { response, resolve } from '@hulla/api-request'

const getUserByIdConfig = (id: string) => ({
  url: `api.com/users/${id}`
} as const)

export const usersAPI = a.router({
  name: 'users',
  routes: [
    // (default, same as no resolver passed)
    a.request.get('getUser', getUserByIdConfig, response), // Promise<Response>

    // resolving the response ‚úÖ
    a.request.get(
      'getUser',
      getUserByIdConfig,
      (req, ctx) => response(req, ctx).then(res => res.json() as User)
    ), // Promise<User>

    // same as above, but with a short-hand üíé
    a.request.get('getUser', getUserByIdConfig, resolve<User>), // Promise<User>
  ]
})
```

### Defining baseURL

It's a fairly common pattern, that you want to keep your code DRY and have your `baseURL` automatically pre-pend to all your request URLs.

To achieve this, you have the following two options:

1. Use the special `baseURL` [context](/docs/api/advanced/context) property.

```ts
const a = api({
  methods: ctx => ({
    request: request(ctx)
  }),
  context: {
    baseURL: 'api.com'
  }
})

export const blogAPI = a.router({
  name: 'blog',
  request: [
     a.request.get('/blog', { url: '/blog' })
     a.request.post('/blog', (data: BlogPost) => ({ url: '/blog', data }))
  ]
})

blogAPI.get('/blog') // fetch('api.com/blog', { method: 'GET' })
blogAPI.post('/blog', { title: 'Hello World', content: 'Hello, World!' }) 
// fetch('api.com/blog', {
  // method: 'POST',
  // body: JSON.stringify({ title: 'Hello World', content: 'Hello, World!' }) 
//})
```

The `baseURL` gets automatically pre-prended to the passed url in config _(happens in `response` call)_

> üí° Also note, we used the same 'route key' with different method. This is useful when we want to map out exact api URLs
> as request keys but we need to distinguish between different methods (and their function types) that use the same URL

2. Adding it manually in an [interceptor](/docs/api/advanced/interceptors) _(or resolver if you need to target specific requests only)_

```ts
export const blogAPI = a.router({
  name: 'blog',
  routes: [
    a.request.post('/blog', (data: BlogPost) => ({
      url,
      data,
    }))
  ],
  interceptors: {
    fn: (req, ctx) => {
      req.url = `api.com${req.url}`
      return req
    }
  }
})
```

> It's up to your personal which pattern you decide to use. Just be careful not to use both at the same time or the `baseURL` will be prepended twice!

### Automatic method Passing

If you have a keen eye, you may have noticed, in none of the examples above did we pass the `method` property. That's because the package does it for you
automatically, specifically in the `response` resolver.

You can still pass methods if you wish, but it's not necessary. 

> If you checked the [Request Type Safety](#request-type-safety) section, you already know, the `method` property will be type-checked against the request.method definition


## Advanced

These are advanced topics that you likely don't need to worry about, but they're here if you're interested.

### Automatic URL params parsing

<Aside variant="warning">
This is an experimental feature, you may run into some issues. If you do, please report them to the package maintainers.
</Aside>

In one of the earlier example we passed a function to the `request.method` that took an `id` parameter.

```ts
a.request.get('userById', (id: string) => ({ url: `api.com/users/${id}`}))
```

However, there's also a fancier way, where the package parses params for you, with the special `rq` helper

```ts
import { rq } from '@hulla/api-request'

export const usersAPI = a.router({
  name: 'users',
  a.request.get('userById', (id: string) => rq({
    url: 'api.com/users/:id',
    params: { id }
  }))
})
```

The `rq` helper will automatically parse your passed `url` _(via complex TypeScript string literals)_ and automatically generate the `params` type for you.

Some examples

```ts
rq({
  url: 'api.com/users/:id', // path params
  params: { id: '123' }
}) // { url: 'api.com/users/123' }
rq({
  url: 'api.com/users/:id/:posts', // nested path params
  params: { id: '123', posts: 'private' }
}) // { url: 'api.com/users/123/private' }
rq({
  url: 'api.com/users?page', // search params
  params: { page: '1' },
}) // { url: 'api.com/users/123?page=1' }
rq({
  url: `api.com/users?page&limit`, // chained search params
  params: { page: '1', limit: '10' }
}) // { url: 'api.com/users?page=1&limit=10' }
```

Note these param definitions are type-safe and will throw a TypeScript error if you pass an invalid param.

```ts
rq({
  url: 'api.com/users/:id',
  params: { bad: '123' } // ‚ùå TypeError: Property bad does not exist on type { id: string }
})
```

### Custom resolvers


Check out the [request type safety](#request-type-safety) chapter first if you haven't, because we'll be using methods straight from it.

Usually it's enough to do the default `response` resolver to do it's thing. If you overwrite it, it's likely going to do you more harm 
than good. Before you look into writing a custom resolver, here are some common use-cases and why __you might not need custom ones__.


> But I need to run a side-effect/middleware in the response!

```ts
a.request.get('example', { url: 'api.com/example'}, (req, ctx) => {
  doSomething()
  return response(req, ctx)
})
```
> I need a different response instead of json

```ts
a.request.get(
  'example',
  { url: 'api.com/example'},
  (req, ctx) => response(req, ctx).then(res => res.text())
)
```

> I need to mutate the URL / arguments

-  Checkout the [`baseURL` section](#defining-baseurl) above. 
- If you need to do something more complex than pre-pend base url, you can do it in two ways:

1. Modify the request object (duhh..)

```ts
a.request.get('userById', (id: string) => ({ url: `api.com/users${id}` }))
```

2. Modify it in the response resolver argument:

```ts
a.request.get('authPeers', { url: 'api.com'}, (req, ctx) => {
  return response({ ...req, url: `${req.url}/${ctx.isAdmin ? 'admins' : 'users'}`}, ctx)
})
```

If you need to do this on every request, you could potentially also write an [interceptor](/docs/api/advanced/interceptors) for it.

> I need a more precise type that `Promise<Response>`

Check the [Response Type Safety](#response-type-safety) chapter above.
___

As you can see, you can manipulate both the request and response pretty much to your liking. If despite this all, yoou still
found a reason to write a custom resolver, first off, feel free to leave me a message as to why, as I'm curious to know
and want to always improve the package -- the only reason I can think of is, if you need to do a different call than `fetch`.

You need to however understand, since we're reliant on `response` to do a lot of heavy lifting, some parts may break.

If we were to look at `response` source code definition:

```ts
// don't worry if you don't understand everything from this, not necessary.
export function response<
  M extends LowercaseMethods | Methods,
  RQ extends TypedRequestConfig<M> | URL | string | Request,
  R2 = Promise<Response>,
>(req: RQ, ctx: Context<string, Lowercase<M>, Args, string>): R2 {
  const url: URL = parseUrl(req, ctx)
  const body = parseBody(req)
  const init = parseRequest(req, url, body, ctx)
  return fetch(url, init) as R2
}
```

As you can see, before passing data to fetch we call these 3 functions. You need to understand what each do, when writing custom resolver:

1. `parseURL` - [Attaches the `baseURL`](#defining-baseurl) and checks if the passed URL is valid, returns `URL` type.
2. `parseBody` - [`data` / `body` serialization](#data-vs-body-serialization).
3. `parseRequest` - [Attaches the `method`](#automatic-method-passing) and parsed body + url fields.

If you write a custom resolver, you need to account for this. Here are two versions

1. Importing and calling these util functions

```ts
import { parseURL, parseBody, parseRequest } from '@hulla/api-request'

a.request.get('example', { url: 'api.com/example' }, (req, ctx) => {
  doSomething()
  const url = parseURL(req, ctx)
  const body = parseBody(req)
  const init = parseRequest(req, url, body, ctx)
  return customFetchCall(url, init) // essentially we just did our version of `response` call
})
```

2. Defining your own version of these functions

```ts
a.request.post('example', { url: 'api.com/example'}, (req, ctx) => {
  // parseURL equivalent
  if (!isValidUrl(req.url)) {
    throw new Error('Invalid URL')
  }
  // careful, we must not forget to pass the baseURL and method!
  customFetchCall(`${ctx.baseURL ?? ''}${req.url}`, { method: ctx.method })
})
// note the `response` works also with Request or URL passed
// this only works with a TypedRequestConfig object, consider it a simpler version of `response`
```

And that's pretty much all you need to know
