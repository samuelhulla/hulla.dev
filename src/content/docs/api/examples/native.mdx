import Aside from '../../../../components/Aside.astro'

Technically this example does not necessitate it's own page, but I wanted to list it
here just to showcase it's possible.

## Standard data fetching

React Native does not introduce any specific native data fetching methods, they are equivalent to
[react's client-side fetching patterns](react#client).

## `@tanstack/query` 

You can check out the official [`@hulla/api-query`](/docs/api/integrations/query) integration for more info.

Here's a minimal example

```ts
import { api } from '@hulla/api'
import { query } from '@hulla/api-query'

const a = api()
export const usersAPI = a.router({
  name: 'users',
  routes: [a.procedure('getAllUsers', () => db.users.get())],
  adapters: { query }, // added the query adapter here
})
```

and then

```tsx
import { useQuery } from '@tanstack/react-query'

export function ClientComponent() {
  const { data } = useQuery(usersAPI.query.call('getAllusers'))
  // ...
}
```


## RSC & server actions

<Aside title="ðŸ§ª Experimental API">
Expo's [`async routes`](https://docs.expo.dev/router/reference/async-routes/) are still an experimental API, that is subject
to possible breaking changes in the future. Right with the planned release of [Expo Router v4](https://x.com/Baconbrix/status/1629909713910480898), we expect the server actions to mirror 
the web standards.
</Aside>

```ts
export function action() {
  'use server'
  return usersAPI.call('getAllUsers')
}
```

But this may be subject to change and is not yet ready for current use.
