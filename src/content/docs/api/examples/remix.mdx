Remix was one of the main pioneers when it came to improving the fetching experience in react eco-system.

Built on top of `react`, it might be worth checking out vanilla [react example](react) fetching patterns first, if you're not familiar with them.

<Aside title="About upcoming react-router@v7">
This guide focuses on current version of Remix and it's available documentation. While there is a `react-router@v7` in the making,
which will essentially replace `remix` as we know it, it's currently under active development and until a stable release is made
with documentation, I don't want to risk providing inaccurate info which might change in near future.

## Loaders

One of the ground-breaking patterns of remix to eliminate loader waterfalls was it's `loader` feature.
Here's how we'd go about implementing it with `@hulla/api`.

```ts
import { api } from '@hulla/api'

const a = api()
export const usersAPI = a.router({
  name: 'users',
  routes: [
    a.procedure('getAllUsers', () => db.users.getAll()),
    a.procedure('getUserById', (id: string) => db.users.get(id)),
    // can be a fetch call, kv store, or anything else
  ],
})
```

and then in your remix route (page) or component

```tsx
import { json, type LoaderFunctionArgs } from '@remix-run/node'
import { useLoaderData } from '@remix-run/react'

export const loader = async ({ params }: LoaderFunctionArgs) => {
  const users = await usersAPI.call('getUserById', params.id)
  return json({ users })
}

export default function Users() {
  const users = useLoaderData<typeof loader>()
  return (
    <div>
      {users.map((user) => (
        <div key={user.id}>{user.name}</div>
      ))}
    </div>
  )
}
```

Since remix `loader` pattern serves as a catch-all for all recommended fetching patterns, that's pretty much all you need to know.

## Forms & actions

Remix is built around the idea of `<form>` _(or it's optimize re-export `<Form>` component)_ submissions.

While the GET requests don't really make much sense, as they are just used for navigation, we can use actions with a `POST` method.

```ts
import { json, type ActionFunctionArgs } from '@remix-run/node'
import { usersAPI } from '@/api/users'

// app/routes/users.new.tsx
export async function action({ request }: ActionFunctionArgs) {
  const body = await request.formData()
  const user = await usersAPI.call('createUser', body)
  return json({ user })
}
```

```tsx
import { action } from './users.new'

export default function NewUser() {
  const actionData = useActionData<typeof action>()
  return (
    <form method="post" action="/users/new">
      {/* ... */}
    </form>
  )
}
```
