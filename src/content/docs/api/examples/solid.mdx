import Aside from '../../../../components/Aside.astro'

Solid has an advantage of being a later stage framework, which could observe which patterns worked and more importantly which didn't from it's older bretheren.

This allows `solid-js` to present a united front when it comes to data fetching and essentially export a single function that works on both server and client.

## Setup

First here's an example api router definition.

```ts
import { api } from '@hulla/api'
import { db } from '../db'

const a = api()
export const usersAPI = a.router({
  name: 'users',
  routes: [
    a.procedure('getUserById', (id: string) => db.users.get(id)),
    a.procedure('createUser', (user: User) => db.users.create(user)),
    a.procedure('example', () => fetch('https://api.com/example')),
    // ...etc
  ]
})
```

> Note, we could also use the [request integration](/docs/api/integrations/requests) for type validated fetch requests and responses.

## Server

<Aside variant="note" title="Re-using on client">
Due to solid's isomorphic nature of being a full-stack framework from the get-go, patterns that work on server automatically work on client
as well. Just remove the `'use server'` from them. But since it's usually preferrable to fetch what you can on server, they will be listed under there.
</Aside>

### actions

Actions are a `@solidjs/router` paradigm for communicating with server, usually _(but not only)_ with forms.

```tsx
import { action, useAction } from '@solidjs/router'
import { usersAPI } from '@/api/users'

const createUser = action(async (user: User) => usersAPI.call('createUser', user))

export function MyComponent() {
  const createUserAction = useAction(createUser)
  return (
    <button onClick={() => createUserAction({ name: 'New User' })}>
      Create New User
    </button>
  )
}
```

or with a `<form>`

```tsx
import { action, useAction } from '@solidjs/router'
import { usersAPI } from '@/api/users'

const createUser = action(async (user: FormData) => usersAPI.call('createUser', user))

export function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <form action={createUser} method="POST">
      <label for="username">Username:</label>
      <input type="text" name="username" />
      <button type="submit">submit</build>
    </form>
  )
}
```

### route loaders

Since solid is opinionated with it's primitives, here's an example using `@solidjs/router` for a server-side load.

```tsx
import { createAsync, cache } from '@solidjs/router'
import { For } from 'solid-js'
import { usersAPI } from '@/api/users'

const getAllUsers = cache(async () => {
  'use server'
  return usersAPI.call('getAllUsers')
}, 'getAllUsers')

export const route = {
  load: () => getAllUsers()
}

export default function Page() {
  const users = createAsync(() => getAllUsers())
  return (
    <For each={users()}>{user => <li>{user.name}</li>}</For>
  )
}
```


## Client

While it's preferred to fetch what you can on server, there are times when you need to fetch data on client.

### createResource

For client, we just call the resource signal

```tsx
import { createResource } from 'solid-js'
import { usersAPI } from '@/api/users'

export default function Page({ id }: { id: string }) {
  const [user] = createResource(id, (id: string) => usersAPI.call('getUserById', id))
  return <div>{user().name}</div>
}
```

### routes (cache + createAsync)

It's the same as the [server - route loaders examples](#route-loaders), just remove the `'use server'` from the cache function.


## @tanstack/solid-query

There's an official integration for `@tanstack/solid-query` as well, which is fairly popular in the solidjs ecosystem.

What's exciting, there's an official [`@hulla/api-query`](/docs/api/integrations/query) integration. While you can read more about
the integration itself and learn how it works by following the link, here's at least a minimal example with it.

```ts
import { api } from '@hulla/api'
import { query } from '@hulla/api-query'

const a = api()
export const usersAPI = a.router({
  name: 'users',
  routes: [
    a.procedure('getUserById', (id: string) => db.users.get(id)),
    a.procedure('createUser', (user: User) => db.users.create(user)),
    a.procedure('example', () => fetch('https://api.com/example')),
    // ...etc
  ],
  adapters: { query }
})
```

and then later in your component / page ui route

```tsx
import { createQuery } from '@tanstack/solid-query'
import { usersAPI } from '@/api/users'

export default function UsersPage() {
  const { data } = createQuery(usersAPI.query.call('getAllUsers')) // ðŸš€ that's all!
  // ...
}
```
